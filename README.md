## Abstract
Wearable Stress and Affect Detection Dataset (17GB)
The dataset is collected from a controlled lab study that focuses on classifying participantsâ€™ emotional states, specifically neutral, stress, and amusement, based on physiological and motion data ultimately collecting the WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset. Data is collected from both wrist and chest-worn devices with 15 subjects reported from both medical professionals as well as self reports from the subjects. The following sensor modalities included are: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and acceleration. With these sensors we are able to explore the important features and trends between the stress classifications of: baseline vs. stress vs. amusement, and compare both devices.
